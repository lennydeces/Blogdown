# load packages

  if (!requireNamespace(x)) install.packages(x)
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
})
```


With **blogdown**, you are able to take advantage of several features of Pandoc's Markdown, including adding citations. You can read more about adding citations in the **bookdown** book [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html). 

This post will demonstrate how you can add citations. There are 3 steps:

1. Save a BibTeX file(s) in the `/content/post/` directory. The file should be a plain-text file that contains citations that generally look like this:

    ```{r tidy = FALSE}
    @ARTICLE{key,
    required_fields [, optional_fields] }
    ```

2. Reference the BibTeX file(s) in the YAML header of your post: 

    ```yaml
    ---
    bibliography: [one.bib, another.bib, yet-another.bib]
    ---
    ```

3. In the text of your post, reference items in BibTeX file(s) using `@key`

# Example 1: Adding citations for books or articles

There are several ways to export citations for books or articles as a BibTeX file. One simple way is to use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) to obtain a BibTeX entry. For example, if you search for "Bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown", you can view the citation by clicking on the quote icon underneath the entry:

![](/images/google-scholar-bibtex.png)

If you then click on the BibTeX link, you will see the formatted plain text version, which you can download as a file with the .bib extension:

```
@book{xie2016bookdown,
  title={Bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown},
  author={Xie, Yihui},
  year={2016},
  publisher={CRC Press}
}
```

To now cite this item in the text of your post, use the format `@key`, so `@xie2016bookdown` generates: @xie2016bookdown. Notice that you can click on the year to see the full reference. In order to do this, add this to your YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
link-citations: true
---
```


# Example 2: Adding cites for R packages using **knitr**

There is a helper function `write_bib()` in the **knitr** package to generate BibTeX entries automatically for R packages. You can use this method to add citations in R Markdown posts in **blogdown**. The difference is that instead of saving your BibTeX file(s), the `write_bib` function will create a BibTeX file for you. If you don't specify a file location, `knitr::write_bib` will create the file in the `/content/post/` directory.

```{r}
# list specific packages
knitr::write_bib(c("package1", "package2"), "packages.bib")
```


```{r}
# or include all used in the post
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "packages.bib") 
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
# include all used and specify different location
knitr::write_bib(.packages(), "../../static/bib/packages.bib") 
```

Add this new BibTeX file (`<file-name-here>.bib`) to your YAML header:

```yaml
---
bibliography: [packages.bib] 
---
```

If you save your BibTeX file(s) to another directory, say in a folder you create like `/static/bib/`, you would update your YAML header with the correct file path (*not* in quotes):

```yaml
---
bibliography: [../../static/bib/packages.bib] 
---
```
    
In the text of your post, reference items in the **knitr**-generated BibTeX file using `@R-packagename`. For example, in this post, we used several R packages including **blogdown** [@R-blogdown] and **knitr** [@R-knitr]. 



From RStudio's section on [citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citations), the following markdown text:

    1. Blah blah [see @R-blogdown, pp. 33-35; also @R-knitr, ch. 1].

    2. Blah blah [@R-blogdown, pp. 33-35].

    3. Blah blah [@R-blogdown; @R-knitr].

    4. Yihui says blah [-@R-blogdown].

    5. @R-blogdown says blah.

Generates these in-text citation styles:

1. Blah blah [see @R-blogdown, pp. 33-35; also @R-knitr, ch. 1].

2. Blah blah [@R-blogdown, pp. 33-35].

3. Blah blah [@R-blogdown; @R-knitr].

4. Yihui says blah [-@R-blogdown].

5. @R-blogdown says blah.

Finally, let's say I want to include a reference to the **bookdown** package without an in-text citation. To do this, we would include this package in our packages.bib file generated from `knitr::write_bib()` and referenceed in the YAML header in the post. Then add this to the YAML header:

```yaml
---
nocite: | 
  @R-bookdown
---
```

Now you should see the **bookdown** package reference listed below.
