# Problem

**Problem:** You want to read in a data file in an R code chunk in an R Markdown post. But:

- Where should you save the data file? 
- What file path will work to run the code chunks in the console?
- What file path will work when you serve site?

**Solution:** Read on.

This post will show you how to add local data files to your **blogdown** site, and the file paths to read those data files in an R code chunk. (If you came here looking for how to add static images and use file paths, please see [this post](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/10/06/adding-figures-and-other-images-to-posts/).)

# TL;DR

Let's say you have a data file called `"mazes.csv"`, and you want to read in that CSV file in an R chunk. The below table summarizes where the file should live in your **blogdown** site directory, and the file paths to use.


<font size="3">

| File location             | File path in R chunk            | File path using here package          |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `/content/post/mazes.csv` | `"mazes.csv"`                   | no need!                              |
| `/static/mazes.csv`       | `"../../static/mazes.csv"`      | `here("static", "mazes.csv")`         |
| `/static/data/mazes.csv`  | `"../../static/data/mazes.csv"` | `here("static", "data", "mazes.csv")` |
| `raw` GitHub url          | `"raw_url/mazes.csv"`                 | no need!                              |

More detail on each of these scenarios below. We'll use `readr::read_csv()`, so you'll need to install and load the **readr** package:
```{r}
# install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
```


## Place file in your `post/` folder

What to do:

- File goes in `/content/post/mazes.csv`
- R file path is `"mazes.csv"`

Example: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
mazes <- read_csv("mazes.csv")
```


## Place file in your `static/` folder

What to do:

- File goes in `/static/mazes.csv`
- R file path is `"../../static/mazes.csv"`
- R file path with [**here**](https://krlmlr.github.io/here/) is: `here("static", "mazes.csv")`

Example: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
mazes <- read_csv("../../static/mazes.csv")
# or
library(here)
mazes <- read_csv(here("static", "mazes.csv"))
```

## Place file in your `static/data/` folder

What to do:

- File goes in `/static/data/mazes.csv`
- R file path is `"../../static/data/mazes.csv"`
- R file path with [**here**](https://krlmlr.github.io/here/) is: `here("static", "data", "mazes.csv")`

Example: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
mazes <- read_csv("../../static/data/mazes.csv")
# or
library(here)
mazes <- read_csv(here("static", "data", "mazes.csv"))
```

## Place `"mazes.csv"` online

What to do:

- File goes online: options include in a [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com) or push to your site's repo
- Use the `raw` GitHub or gist url

Example: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
mazes_gist <- "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kylebgorman/77ce12c9167554ade560af9d34565c11/raw/c5d653fb146821ecd96a9aa085263c3f17480dd5/McFarlaneEtAl_MazeData-Deidentified.csv"
mazes <- read_csv(mazes_gist)
```


# HERE

How did [**here**](https://krlmlr.github.io/here/) work? 

```{r}
# use here to build the file path
library(here)

# read in the file
mazes <- read_csv(here("static", "data", "mazes.csv"))
mazes
```

Now that is some serious black magic. Let's break down what the **here** package did.

```{r}
# where are we?
here() 

# if mazes.csv were in static, this is the file path
here("static", "mazes.csv")

# but it is not! it is in /static/data
here("static", "data", "mazes.csv")

# you can read in directly
mazes1 <- read_csv(here("static", "data", "mazes.csv"))

# you can save the file path 
mazes_file <- here("static", "data", "mazes.csv")

# then read that in
mazes2 <- read_csv(mazes_file)
```
