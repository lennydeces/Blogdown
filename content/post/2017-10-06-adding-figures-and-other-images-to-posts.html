<p>With <strong>blogdown</strong>, you can include figures that result from R code like plots, as well as images from other sources in posts. For the former, you will need to be working from an R Markdown post, but for the latter, you can be working in either a markdown or R Markdown post. To read more about the differences between the two posting formats, read <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html">this chapter</a> in the <strong>blogdown</strong> book.</p>
<div id="example-1-including-figures-from-r-code" class="section level1">
<h1>Example 1: Including figures from R code</h1>
<p>In an R Markdown post, you can insert an R code chunk that produces a figure like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
oplot &lt;- ggplot(Orange, aes(x = age, 
                   y = circumference, 
                   colour = Tree)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  guides(colour = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
oplot</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-10-06-adding-figures-and-other-images-to-posts_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>You can use the <strong>knitr</strong> chunk options to control aspects of how the figure is displayed. Read more about these options in the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html"><strong>bookdown</strong> book</a>.</p>
<p>You may also use the chunk options to automatically produce numbered figures with captions. To do this, you will need to do two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Label the R code chunk used to produce the figure</li>
<li>Use the <code>fig.cap =</code> chunk option to provide a figure caption.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the chunk label should not have underscores; it should only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-).</p>
<p>To reference the figure in the text of your post, use the syntax <code>\@ref(fig:chunk-label)</code>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> where <code>chunk-label</code> is the label of the chunk containing the R code that produces the figure.</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r orange-tree-fig, fig.cap = &quot;Growth of orange trees&quot;}
oplot
```</code></pre>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:orange-tree-fig"></span>
<img src="/post/2017-10-06-adding-figures-and-other-images-to-posts_files/figure-html/orange-tree-fig-1.png" alt="Growth of orange trees" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Growth of orange trees
</p>
</div>
<p>Now, a reference in the text of the post to <code>\@ref(fig:orange-tree-fig)</code> will produce a link to Figure <a href="#fig:orange-tree-fig">1</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-including-other-images" class="section level1">
<h1>Example 2: Including other images</h1>
<p>You have a few options for adding other types of images to posts. First, you can use markdown syntax, as in:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>![](/path/to/my/image.png)</code></pre>
<p>In a <strong>blogdown</strong> site, this image file is assumed to be located in the <code>/static/</code> directory. So if you save your image file in a subdirectory called <code>/static/images/</code>, the file path would be <code>(/images/image.png)</code>.</p>
<p>If you are working in an R Markdown post, you may also include images via the function <code>knitr::include_graphics()</code> within an R code chunk. Again, <strong>blogdown</strong> assumes that the image file is in your <code>/static/</code> directory, so the file path you provide should be relative to that directory. In the example below, the knit-logo.png file is located in the <code>/static/images/</code> directory.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(rep(&#39;/images/knit-logo.png&#39;, 3))</code></pre>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:knitr-logo"></span>
<img src="/images/knit-logo.png" alt="Three knitr logos included in the document from an external PNG image file." width="32.8%" /><img src="/images/knit-logo.png" alt="Three knitr logos included in the document from an external PNG image file." width="32.8%" /><img src="/images/knit-logo.png" alt="Three knitr logos included in the document from an external PNG image file." width="32.8%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2: Three knitr logos included in the document from an external PNG image file.
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:knitr-logo">2</a> is an example of three <strong>knitr</strong> logos included in a figure environment. You can read more about the advantages of using the <code>knitr::include_graphics()</code> function <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html">here</a>.</p>
