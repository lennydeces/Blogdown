This is a minimal example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. Here you will find posts demonstrating how to use R Markdown features. For example:

- [**Adding citations**](/2017/08/28/adding-citations-to-posts/): how to add cites from an external BibTex file and how to cite R packages within a **blogdown** post.

- [**Adding R Markdown documents**](/2017/09/06/adding-r-markdown-documents-of-other-output-formats/): examples of how to render R Markdown documents as a PDF document and an HTML5 presentation using **blogdown**.

- [**Adding HTML widgets**](/2017/09/07/adding-htmlwidgets-to-r-markdown-posts/): we show you examples of embedding a DataTable from the [DT package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) and an interactive plot using the [plotly package](https://plot.ly/r/).

- [**Adding R code**](/2017/09/07/adding-htmlwidgets-to-r-markdown-posts/): examples of using R chunks and inline R code.

- [**Adding figures and images**](/2017/10/06/adding-figures-and-other-images-to-posts/): examples of including plots and .png files.

- [**Adding GIFs**](/2018/01/31/gif-animations/): shows how to make animated GIFs using plots made in R.
